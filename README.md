The idea is an online clinic appointment booking application for mobile devices in which patients can book appointments in Optometry, Dentistry, and Physiotherapy clinics.
A new user must sign up with the application by providing their name, address, contact details, medical conditions, and the details of the health insurance service provider. After successful login, users can view the options to select the type of clinic from optometry, physiotherapy, and Dentistry. According to the user's choice of the kind of clinic, the nearby clinics are displayed which accept the insurance provider of the user and the user can select an open slot from the available list.
The proposed system would be helpful for the users to book an appointment with the clinic where the insurance provider of the user is accepted. The users will save time and effort of clinical visits and telephonic calls for booking an appointment.
